#Researchers collected measurements from loblolly pines.
#
#Set the proportions for the training dataset to 65%, validation dataset to 10%, and testing dataset to 25%.
#The code provided contains all imports, loads the dataset, splits the dataset into training, validation, and test datasets, prints the sizes of these samples, and prints the test dataset.

# Import packages and functions
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

rng = np.random.RandomState(33)

# Load the dataset
loblolly = pd.read_csv('loblollySample.csv')

# Set proportions of train-validate-test split

# Your code goes here 
trainingPropPercent = 32 #ANSWER
validatingPropPercent = 5 #ANSWER
testingPropPercent = 13 #ANSWER

# Split dataset into training/validation data and testing data

# Split training/validation data into training data and validation data
